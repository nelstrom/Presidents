## Using this repository to [follow the screencast][video]

First, you'll have to clone this repository:

    git clone git://github.com/senchalearn/Presidents.git

Change into the directory:

    cd Presidents

By default, the git clone command will only create the master branch locally. If you want to study the code at each checkpoint, you will have to fetch each of the other branches. You can do so by running the following:

    git checkout -b 00_blank_slate origin/00_blank_slate
    git checkout -b 01_basic_setup origin/01_basic_setup
    git checkout -b 02_grouped_list origin/02_grouped_list
    git checkout -b 03_list_with_index origin/03_list_with_index
    git checkout -b 04_add_navigation_view origin/04_add_navigation_view
    git checkout -b 05_personalize_detail_panel origin/05_personalize_detail_panel
